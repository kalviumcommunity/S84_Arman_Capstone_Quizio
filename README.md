# Quizio – Capstone Project

## 🚀 Project Title:
**Quizio – A Peer-to-Peer Academic Doubt-Solving Platform**

## 💡 Project Idea (Brief Description)
Quizio is a peer-to-peer doubt-solving platform where students can post academic queries using text, images, or videos. Fellow learners can respond to these doubts and earn points for each helpful solution. Points are used to ask new doubts after an initial free quota, encouraging active participation and quality responses. If a doubt remains unresolved for 24 hours, it is escalated to a dedicated support team.

Key features include:
- Doubt submission with media support
- Coin-based incentive system
- Answer rating and reporting system
- Auto-escalation for unanswered doubts
- Leaderboard, user profiles, and admin panel
- Premium membership support
- Clean and responsive UI/UX

Built with a modern full-stack tech stack: **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.
